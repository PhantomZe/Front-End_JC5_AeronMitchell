                                The action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, 
                                including handâ€“eye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes a large variety of sub-genres,
                                such as fighting games, beat 'em ups, shooter games and platform games which are widely considered
                                the most important action games, though multiplayer online battle arena and some real-time strategy
                                games are also considered to be action games.

                                In an action game, the player typically controls a character often in the form of a protagonist 
                                or avatar. This player character must navigate a level, collecting objects, avoiding obstacles,
                                and battling enemies with their natural skills as well as weapons and other tools at their disposal.
                                At the end of a level or group of levels, the player must often defeat a boss enemy that is more 
                                challenging and often a major antagonist in the game's story. Enemy attacks and obstacles deplete the 
                                player character's health and lives, and the player receives a Game over when they run out of lives. 
                                Alternatively, the player gets to the end of the game by finishing a sequence of levels and seeing the 
                                credits.
